# I will make a bold Claim, by saying that basically everything in Python is an Object

## String, Int, Boolean

```python
name = "Nico"

# So we said everything is an object, what do you guys think this will throw?
print(isinstance(name, str))

# What about this?
print(isinstance(name, object))

liste = ["Sebastian", 29, True]

for element in liste:
    print(isinstance(element, object))
```
### So If everything in Python is an Object, does that mean we automatically do Object Oriented Programming?

Creating Classes and Objects does not necessarily have much to do with Object Oriented Programming.
<br>
OOP is a paradigm that uses objects and classes to design software.
We now have to find a definition for the following key concepts -> Classes, Objects, Attributes, Methods

### Classes:
    Blueprints for creating objects. A class defines a set of attributes and methods that its objects will have.
### Objects: 
    Instances of classes. An object is a self-contained component that contains properties and methods needed to make a certain type of data useful.


### Methods:
    Functions defined inside a class. They describe the behaviors of an object.#


### Attributes
    Variables that hold data which belongs to a class or instance.

### Benefits of OOP 
    Abstraction: Encourages the division of a program into distinct parts. -> Breaking down complexity
    Reusability: Code can be reused through inheritance, leading to a reduction in redundancy.
    Encapsulation: Keeps the internal representation of an object hidden from the outside.
    Polymorphism: Allows entities to be treated in multiple forms, enhancing flexibility.
